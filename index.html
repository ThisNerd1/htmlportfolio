    <!-- <p> In my hometown of Marvell, Arkansas, agriculture stands as the primary occupation for its people. <br/> 
    Agriculture never interested me. I desired to do something outside of the norm.<br/>
    I wasn't sure what I wanted to do, but that's the fun part about life, (according to my grandpa). <br/> 
    I applied to all types of colleges, and even a few trade schools. <br/>
    I was determined to find a career that felt like a new pair of gloves, a perfect fit. <br/>
    While I received acceptance letters from a couple of colleges, one of them stood out odd from the rest.<br/>
    It was in Salt Lake City, Utah. <br/> 
    A place I never been, (and don't remember applying for,) 
    specifically for people studying something I've heard only few brainiacs could do, computer science.<br/>
    A spark lit inside me as I read more. <br/> 
    I gambled success on everything as I moved miles from home, studying in something no one I knew had a clue about. <br/>
    It was the best decision I ever made. <br/> After four years of sleepless nights, semicolons missing, 11:59PM due dates, and instant noodles for breakfast, lunch, and dinner;<br/>
    I am closer than ever to the day I eat my fruit of hardwork and dedication,
    I'll graduate, walk the stage and receive my Bachelor's Degree in Web Design and Development.<br/>
    Learning how to build, code, and design websites has been a lovely journey. My aim is to make Web Developers 
    proud with the projects and website I've made so far. <br/>
